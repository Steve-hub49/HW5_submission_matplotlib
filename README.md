# Pymaceuticals - The Power of Plots
This is my repository link for HW5 Pymaceuticals material.

As background, I have been given access to the complete data from Pymaceuticals Inc.'s most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

A Jupyter Notebook was developed to address the task of generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The notebook also provides a top-level summary of the study results.
