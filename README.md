## Pymaceuticals - The Power of Plots
This is my repository link for HW5 Pymaceuticals material.

As background, I have been given access to the complete data from Pymaceuticals Inc.'s most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

A Jupyter Notebook was developed to address the task of generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The notebook also provides a top-level summary of the study results.

The following three observations were made based on a review of the Pymaceuticals study data:

Capomulin (along with Ramicane) yielded the lowest tumor volume across all drugs tested.
A line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin shows a significant reduction in tumor volume over a 45-day period.
The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84, reflecting a strong correlation between these two factors.
The above observations are also documented at the top of the Jupyter Notebook.

In closing, please know that I studied course material and researched the web but was unable to combine all four box plots into a single figure. I was able to document and display the four individual box plots in the Jupyter Notebook. Thank you in advance for any consideration around this portion of the activity.
